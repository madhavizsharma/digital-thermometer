<h1>Digital Thermometer using Arduino Uno</h1>

Thermometers are useful apparatus being used since long time for temperature measurement. In this arduino based digital thermometer project we need to make a thermometer which displays the current ambient temperature on a 16x2 LCD display unit. For temperature sensing, we will be using LM35 temperature sensor and will interface it with the arduino uno. Arduino will be taking the temperature data and displaying on the LCD.
